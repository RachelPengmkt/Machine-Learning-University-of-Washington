    "* apply standard preprocessing techniques on Wikipedia text data\n",
    "* use GraphLab Create to fit a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that a major feature distinguishing the LDA model from our previously explored methods is the notion of *mixed membership*. Throughout the course so far, our models have assumed that each data point belongs to a single cluster. k-means determines membership simply by shortest distance to the cluster center, and Gaussian mixture models suppose that each data point is drawn from one of their component mixture distributions. In many cases, though, it is more realistic to think of data as genuinely belonging to more than one cluster or category - for example, if we have a model for text data that includes both \"Politics\" and \"World News\" categories, then an article about a recent meeting of the United Nations should have membership in both categories rather than being forced into just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we will use GraphLab Create tools to fit an LDA model to a corpus of Wikipedia articles and examine the results to analyze the impact of a mixed membership approach. In particular, we want to identify the topics discovered by the model in terms of their most important words, and we want to use the model to predict the topic membership distribution for a given document.

    "We'll start by trying to identify the topics learned by our model with some major themes. As a preliminary check on the results of applying this method, it is reasonable to hope that the model has been able to learn topics that correspond to recognizable categories. In order to do this, we must first recall what exactly a 'topic' is in the context of LDA. \n",

    "In the video lectures on LDA we learned that a topic is a probability distribution over words in the vocabulary; that is, each topic assigns a particular probability to every one of the unique words that appears in our data. Different topics will assign different probabilities to the same word: for instance, a topic that ends up describing science and technology articles might place more probability on the word 'university' than a topic that describes sports or politics. Looking at the highest probability words in each topic will thus give us a sense of its major themes.

    "We have now seen how the hyperparameters alpha and gamma influence the characteristics of our LDA topic model, but we haven't said anything about what settings of alpha or gamma are best. We know that these parameters are responsible for controlling the smoothness of the topic distributions for documents and word distributions for topics, but there's no simple conversion between smoothness of these distributions and quality of the topic model. In reality, there is no universally \"best\" choice for these parameters. Instead, finding a good topic model requires that we be able to both explore the output (as we did by looking at the topics and checking some topic predictions for documents) and understand the impact of hyperparameter settings (as we have in this section)."
