       "'This is absolutely by far the best diaper pail money can buy  Never do we detect a diaper odor and my husband has a very sensitive sense of smell and is usually very quick to complain about such things  For those who say they have a problem with the Diaper Champ getting stuckthe ONLY time this ever happens to us is when the bag is full and needs to be changed  We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags makes it much more economical  We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning  We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like its getting stuckthen we change the bag  For us this means about once a week  Not only is the Champ EASY to use its kind of fun  Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells  But shes two months old now and we still just cant say enough good things about itUPDATE  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ  Shes eating solid foods diapers are smellier but the Champ is still doing its job  We empty once a week and spray with Lysol  Yes there is an odor when changing the bag but we take the bag directly out to the trash spray Champ with Lysol insert new bag and close the thing back up  Everything is just fine after that  We are so glad we have the Diaper Champ and cannot sing its praises enough'"
