# Machine-Learning-University-of-Washington

## My machine learning projects about regression, classification and clustering All projects are completed using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn and matplotlib. 

There are 4 courses in the Machine Learning Specialization provided by University of Washington via Coursera.

Course 1: Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach

Course 2: Machine Learning: Regression

Course 3: Machine Learning: Classification

Course 4: Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval

While the guidelines of the assignments were provided n in Graphlab, I choose to use Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn to enhance my coding skills.
