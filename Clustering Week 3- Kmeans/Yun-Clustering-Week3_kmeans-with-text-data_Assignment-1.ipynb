    "Since we are measuring the tightness of the clusters, a higher value of K reduces the possible heterogeneity metric by definition. For example, if we have N data points and set K=N clusters, then we could have 0 cluster heterogeneity by setting the N centroids equal to the values of the N data points. (Note: Not all runs for larger K will result in lower heterogeneity than a single run with smaller K due to local optima.) Let's see explore this general trend for ourselves by performing the following analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the kmeans_multiple_runs function to run k-means with five different values of K. For each K, use k-means++ and multiple runs to pick the best solution. In what follows, we consider K=2,10,25,50,100 and 7 restarts for each setting.\n",

    "IMPORTANT: The code block below will take about one hour to finish. We highly suggest that you use the arrays that we have computed for you. Side note: In practice, a good implementation of k-means would utilize parallelism to run multiple runs of k-means at once. For an example, see scikit-learn's KMeans."

As we will see in the following section, setting K too high may end up separating data points that are actually pretty alike. At the extreme, we can set individual data points to be their own clusters (K=N) and achieve zero heterogeneity, but separating each data point into its own cluster is hardly a desirable outcome. In the following section, we will learn how to detect a K set \"too large\"."
